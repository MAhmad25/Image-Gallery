## üîÆ What's Next? Future Enhancements

The gallery is awesome, but there's always room to grow! Here are some features I'm planning to implement next:

- **[ ] User Authentication**: Allow users to sign up and log in to save their liked images to a personal collection.
- **[ ] Image Uploads**: Implement functionality for users to contribute their own images to the gallery.
- **[ ] Backend Integration**: Connect the application to a backend service (like Firebase or a custom Node.js API) for persistent data storage.
- **[ ] Advanced Search Filters**: Enhance the search with filters for color, orientation (portrait/landscape), and more.
